                                                    Rules of the Game 

    1. This game can be played by 2 players â€“ One player is the user and the website will act as the other player who is called as Tharindu
    2. 2 Jokers in the deck of cards will not be considered for this game
    3. Rest of the cards will be shuffled and divided equally among the 2 players i.e.  13 cards per player and cards will belong to 4 types which are Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades.
    4. Each player has to play one card at a time, and that set will win by the player who played the highest card
       Ex : If Tharindu plays the Hearts 3 and the user plays Hearts 5, then that set will win by the user and the two cards will belong to the user.

	     If the user does not have any card with the type Hearts, the user can play a card of any other type and then irrespective of the value of the card, that set will win by Tharindu and both cards 
       will belong to Tharindu.
	
	  Note : Winning cards should keep separately and should not be again used for playing. 

    5.  The cards will be considered in ascending order for any type is as follows.

	     2  < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A

    6. Ultimately one player will left with no cards and therefore other player will be the winner.
